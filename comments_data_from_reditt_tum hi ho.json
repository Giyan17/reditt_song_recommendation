    "body": "This is Wirerims official YT page's comment on Wangs video:\n\nThis might be the Wirerims song \u201cDo Right\u201d from debut album \u201cSelf-Construction\u201d originally released in autumn of 2017, but only Glittering Craft would be able to confirm.  Please see below.\r  \n\r  \nWirerims is a local band from Denton, Texas that began to get spins on 91.7 KXT during the mentioned time. KXT is not just a Denton station, it's based out of Dallas, but it serves the DFW area (Dallas-Fort Worth and surrounding North Texas cities) \r  \n\r  \nKXT is a terrific local radio station that dedicates much of their programming to local musicians. Wirerims sent a song of our debut album \"Self-Construction\" called \"Maybe Lions\" to KXT. Amy Miller and Gini Mascorro responded to our email with the kindest and most-thoughtful response imaginable. While they said they liked the song \"Maybe Lions\", they were really excited about the song \"Do Right\" from the album. They said they would not only like to feature the song on the local show, but put it in regular rotation on the station. This was very exciting news for us as a young, new band. \r  \n\r  \nWhenever the song \"Do Right\" was played on KXT our friends, family, and fans who were tuned in would contact us. This was so cool and affirming, and we're forever grateful to KXT for their support of Wirerims and the many talented indie musicians in the area. \r  \n\r  \nAround the time when \"Do Right\" as being played regularly on KXT I began making notes of when listeners said they heard the song. I actually used the KXT Playlist database at the time to try and track and find when exactly the song was being played and what other bands were in the set (because I thought it was so cool we were being played back-to-back with legendary bands like Fleetwood Mac, Jimi Hendrix, Nirvana, et al. I still have records of when the song was played (along with some of the other songs played during the set) on KXT during the time mentioned by Glittering Craft.  If it was not our song, perhaps it was one of the other songs listed during the set.\r  \n\r  \nHere are the two sets I have from the matching dates, but the times may be off if they were listening in a different time zone:\r  \n\r  \nFebruary 9th, 2018 (around 7AM central time zone)\r  \n\r  \n\u201cCommotion\u201d \u2013 Creedence Clearwater Revival\r  \n\u201cMudfootball\u201d \u2013 Jack Johnson\r  \n\u201cLongshot\u201d \u2013 Catfish and the Bottlemen\r  \n\u201cIn a Little While\u201d \u2013 U2\r  \n\u201cFriend of the Devil\u201d \u2013 Grateful Dead\r  \n\u201cA Common Disaster\u201d \u2013 Cowboy Junkies\r  \n\u201c99\u201d \u2013 Barns Courtney\r  \n\u201cDo Right\u201d \u2013 Wirerims\r  \n\u201cOur House\u201d \u2013 Madness \r  \n\u201c10 Mile Stereo\u201d \u2013 Beach House\r  \n\r  \nFebruary 14th, 2018 (around 4AM central time zone)\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWithin Your Reach\u201d \u2013 The Replacements \r  \n\u201cHide\u201d \u2013 Rainbow Kitten Surprise\r  \n\u201cSoul to Squeeze\u201d \u2013 Red Hot Chili Peppers\r  \n\u201cGoing to California\u201d \u2013 Led Zeppelin\r  \n\u201cYou\u2019re Somebody Else\u201d \u2013 Flora Cash\r  \n\u201cUp Up Up\u201d \u2013 Givers\r  \n\u201cBambi\u201d \u2013 Hippo Campus\r  \n\u201cEarn Enough for Us\u201d \u2013 XTC\r  \n\u201cDo Right\u201d \u2013 Wirerims\r  \n\u201cThe Walker\u201d \u2013 Fitz and the Tantrums\r  \n\u201cGold Soundz\u201d \u2013 Pavement\r  \n\r  \nWhile I am uncertain that \u201cDo Right\u201d is the song Glittering Craft is searching for (because of the lyrics mentioned, and I can\u2019t imagine our song what anyone would consider being \u201cthe best song they ever heard\u201d), the song does very closely match the description \u201cmale singer with young voice, melodic punk, not acoustic, and full band with bass guitar, guitar, and drums, emotive, and a great guitar solo\u201d \\*personal note, I am proud of the guitar solo. (the remastered version of the album was re-released in 2019 btw)\r  \n\r  \nThere is another Denton band that I immediately thought of when reading the description that goes by the name Sad Cops.\r  \n\r  \nI hope this helps in some way to either locate or rule out the song Glittering Craft is searching for.  This whole situation very much reminds me of the Nickelodeon show \u201cAdventures of Pete & Pete\u201d episode \u201cHard Day\u2019s Pete\u201d where Little Pete is trying to remember a song he heard a garage band playing one day that got stuck in his head.  (Do yourself a favor and watch this show/episode)\r  \n\r  \nThis is a touching and heart-wrenching story. I am very sorry to hear about the terminal diagnosis, but very much inspired by Glittering Craft's mission and dying wish.  I wish them comfort and peace during this difficult time.  With love and respect.  -Billy (Wirerims)",

    "body": "Here is a comment from a youtube video which talks about the story, comment from someone who might have found the song, and possibly actually sang it.\n\nLink to the comment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYOQzLmqUUE&lc=UgzvBTNWotnFp1_w-Rh4AaABAg\n\nComment:\n\n```txt\nThis might be the Wirerims song \u201cDo Right\u201d from debut album \u201cSelf-Construction\u201d originally released in autumn of 2017, but only Glittering Craft would be able to confirm.  Please see below.\n\nWirerims is a local band from Denton, Texas that began to get spins on 91.7 KXT during the mentioned time. KXT is not just a Denton station, it's based out of Dallas, but it serves the DFW area (Dallas-Fort Worth and surrounding North Texas cities) \n\nKXT is a terrific local radio station that dedicates much of their programming to local musicians. Wirerims sent a song of our debut album \"Self-Construction\" called \"Maybe Lions\" to KXT. Amy Miller and Gini Mascorro responded to our email with the kindest and most-thoughtful response imaginable. While they said they liked the song \"Maybe Lions\", they were really excited about the song \"Do Right\" from the album. They said they would not only like to feature the song on the local show, but put it in regular rotation on the station. This was very exciting news for us as a young, new band. \n\nWhenever the song \"Do Right\" was played on KXT our friends, family, and fans who were tuned in would contact us. This was so cool and affirming, and we're forever grateful to KXT for their support of Wirerims and the many talented indie musicians in the area. \n\nAround the time when \"Do Right\" as being played regularly on KXT I began making notes of when listeners said they heard the song. I actually used the KXT Playlist database at the time to try and track and find when exactly the song was being played and what other bands were in the set (because I thought it was so cool we were being played back-to-back with legendary bands like Fleetwood Mac, Jimi Hendrix, Nirvana, et al. I still have records of when the song was played (along with some of the other songs played during the set) on KXT during the time mentioned by Glittering Craft.  If it was not our song, perhaps it was one of the other songs listed during the set.\n\nHere are the two sets I have from the matching dates, but the times may be off if they were listening in a different time zone:\n\nFebruary 9th, 2018 (around 7AM central time zone)\n\n\u201cCommotion\u201d \u2013 Creedence Clearwater Revival\n\u201cMudfootball\u201d \u2013 Jack Johnson\n\u201cLongshot\u201d \u2013 Catfish and the Bottlemen\n\u201cIn a Little While\u201d \u2013 U2\n\u201cFriend of the Devil\u201d \u2013 Grateful Dead\n\u201cA Common Disaster\u201d \u2013 Cowboy Junkies\n\u201c99\u201d \u2013 Barns Courtney\n\u201cDo Right\u201d \u2013 Wirerims\n\u201cOur House\u201d \u2013 Madness \n\u201c10 Mile Stereo\u201d \u2013 Beach House\n\nFebruary 14th, 2018 (around 4AM central time zone)\n\n\u201cWithin Your Reach\u201d \u2013 The Replacements \n\u201cHide\u201d \u2013 Rainbow Kitten Surprise\n\u201cSoul to Squeeze\u201d \u2013 Red Hot Chili Peppers\n\u201cGoing to California\u201d \u2013 Led Zeppelin\n\u201cYou\u2019re Somebody Else\u201d \u2013 Flora Cash\n\u201cUp Up Up\u201d \u2013 Givers\n\u201cBambi\u201d \u2013 Hippo Campus\n\u201cEarn Enough for Us\u201d \u2013 XTC\n\u201cDo Right\u201d \u2013 Wirerims\n\u201cThe Walker\u201d \u2013 Fitz and the Tantrums\n\u201cGold Soundz\u201d \u2013 Pavement\n\nWhile I am uncertain that \u201cDo Right\u201d is the song Glittering Craft is searching for (because of the lyrics mentioned, and I can\u2019t imagine our song what anyone would consider being \u201cthe best song they ever heard\u201d), the song does very closely match the description \u201cmale singer with young voice, melodic punk, not acoustic, and full band with bass guitar, guitar, and drums, emotive, and a great guitar solo\u201d *personal note, I am proud of the guitar solo. (the remastered version of the album was re-released in 2019 btw)\n\nThere is another Denton band that I immediately thought of when reading the description that goes by the name Sad Cops.\n\nI hope this helps in some way to either locate or rule out the song Glittering Craft is searching for.  This whole situation very much reminds me of the Nickelodeon show \u201cAdventures of Pete & Pete\u201d episode \u201cHard Day\u2019s Pete\u201d where Little Pete is trying to remember a song he heard a garage band playing one day that got stuck in his head.  (Do yourself a favor and watch this show/episode)\n\nThis is a touching and heart-wrenching story. I am very sorry to hear about the terminal diagnosis, but very much inspired by Glittering Craft's mission and dying wish.  I wish them comfort and peace during this difficult time.  With love and respect.  -Billy (Wirerims)\n```",

I would start jobs and last a week or two. Then about 3 years ago I learned to drive (something I never thought I would do) and I started actually being able to hold down a job. Even though I get praise for coming so far over the last couple weeks I think I started having a midlife crisis as I want to do more. I want to maybe start a business but don't know where to start and it has been getting me down.\n\nI thank you for your post as you have just put everything into perspective.

Saw someone in the comments called TheClassicRPGist say to look into Bayside, which now that I think of it have some similar lyric content! I definitely think looking into bands people in the emo/scene crowd listened to in the 2010's might be a good place to look. Hope this helps!\n\nWait, I swear I've heard those lyrics before!!! I know I'm some rando on the internet, but I'm certain I've heard the lyrics 'I couldn't try for anything, I couldn't stomach things, it just keeps getting worse' with a similar melody from *somewhere!* I'm one of those people that pay more attention to the lyrics in a song than the music, and an absolute sucker for some awesome lyric writing. I've been listening to the punk genre since around 2006, listening to both old and new stuff, and had a *huge* obsession with indie artists back in the limewire days. Found the band Saves The Day thanks to that virus-infested program, which I know next to no one that's heard of that band. I don't have a lot of my old music, but if it helps people out I live in Arkansas, in the upper left corner of the state! I don't know if I heard that on the radio, but if it's one of the songs I came across on the internet, then it may still be out there and not just something played on a Texas radio! But, definitely take all of this with a grain of salt.",

You said it's similar, but not \"it\".\n\nA snippet of it was played in Whang's video, and it superficially reminded me of some of Bayside's stuff. Though, they're stylistically all over the place, so it might take me a bit to listen through their discography to find which one is causing me to make that connection.\n\nPosting this comment just so I don't forget to do this later. \n\nI don't listen to radio, but the previously mentioned piece, that \"wasn't it\", is giving me de ja vu, even though it's my first time hearing it, which makes me believe I've streamed it on Spotify at some point, even if it isn't from the band I suggested.\nSo, I'll be looking through my playlists, as well as the auto-recommended songs below them.",

    "body": "So in college I used to host an obscure music radio show. This was back in 2011 and in the US, but my old cohost and I will constantly play this game of \u201cwhat was that song we played\u201d nowadays. Here are some things to consider to help with your search: \n\n* **First and foremost, update your main post.** There are comments from people saying it\u2019s an acoustic song, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s melodic punk, and I\u2019m sure further down there are some people thinking otherwise. Updating the \u201cOkay here is everything I know\u201d section with updated info is going to get your way better answers. \n\n* **Mention what artists they sound like.** Yes, you can say \u201cit was so unique that it doesn\u2019t fit anything.\u201d But list out things like\u2026. \u201cThe singer was a mix between Freddy Mercury and Sid Vicious.\u201d ||| \u201cThe tempo was like X, y, or z song\u201d ||| \u201cThe vibe reminded me of The Kooks meets old 30 Seconds to Mars\u201d. Anything to relate it to another song, specific genre, or voice will give a ton of help to people. \n\n* **Lyrics change in our head over time, even seconds after.** Did you actually write it down IMMEDIATELY, or did you write it down 15-30 minutes, or even an hour after? (If you can remember). After 1 hour, we forget almost 50% of what we heard / learned - even if it was impactful. The reason I mention this is saying you wrote it down immediately gives you maybe 80\u201390% chance of remembering the lyrics well. 30 - 60 minutes after, while you were singing it along the way home, and distracted by other things before writing it down could only be 50% certainty or less. BUT, if we get this information we have a more accurate way to know \u201cokay so it could be off a bit from what they said\u201d vs. what is stated almost exactly (which is what it seems like currently). \n\n* **Find the local Sub** Find the local subreddit for Denton. Post it on there and maybe it was someone\u2019s brother\u2019s friends ex-boyfriend who knows the song. \n\n* **Spotify or Pandora Stations** Listen to a completely different genre of music for an hour, switch back to similar genre of the song you\u2019re looking for. Rinse repeat, but shorter periods for the similar genre song. What you\u2019re trying to do is trigger some memories of the song and see if it was truly that genre you remember. Don\u2019t just listen to the one genre searching for the song or they can start to blend together over time. \n\n* **Show Time** Do you by chance remember if there were any competitions around then going on for bands? Look at events in Denton for mid-2017 to mid-2018. Look at band line ups. You can use advanced google searches to set a specific time frame. If Denton is an area people usually just pass through, think about the cities before and after you as bands normally go on tour. \n\n[Here\u2019s a Link to my Master Playlist which is a smorgasbord of music.](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/24r8oUTwU7fTYkBtm8rYJF?si=XmD1VaFdTqygO0pxMtAlKA). There\u2019s definitely some modern indie/rock popular stuff like The Dead South, Judah + The Lion, and Spoon; along with some 90s/00s rock/alt classics like Our Lady Peace, Muse, and CCR; but you\u2019ll get into some fun stuff with bands like [Ruby Waters](https://open.spotify.com/track/0q4z2SfNq3rUvafDcGSpyr?si=KbbwjPHJQjmvqKLOt4Q62w), [Ripe](https://open.spotify.com/track/00KiXBZT9vf1XhcqkFrzug?si=hudtjHDPS--OuNHQ3oLOVA), [The Last Bison](https://open.spotify.com/track/3CbvuuH7GFsO6rF3TmT1su?si=gq6AjjVeRW-nOD2yhm7oWg), or [Donna Missal](https://open.spotify.com/track/5OGPTs1IY8XiBaAhlD67U9?si=rr_JsNZdQfqIxvXUzPKvOw)\n\nOr if you want to get deeper some [Stop Light Observations](https://open.spotify.com/track/2l8LktQUyVtdvN640GzonX?si=o8nuGS7LRyGaFJ8YaktBEA), [Andre Costello & The Cool Minors](https://open.spotify.com/track/7hBqLlkrFRB2X9iKLcdJ7t?si=_Cs6iCkNR2WvchQzy97J8A), [Mega Ran](https://open.spotify.com/track/2QL7IyLenuwhhsweKLnSL5?si=jfYCezFiSSaOYOwLYoy_OQ), or [Hoots and Hellmouth](https://open.spotify.com/track/3LNxazvPwQm5GOIqwDTP10?si=KuucXQJCQD6MfGBhlTU_xQ&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A5aeTg5O9R7lUWwTPXpXODx). \n\nIf you drop some of your favorite genres I can definitely get more granular.",

It was an awesome live-recorded rendition of a song I\u2019d never heard before with a full orchestral backing. I enjoyed the hell out of it, but when I got home and looked it up, I couldn\u2019t find that version of the song. The \u201cofficial\u201d version wasn\u2019t as good. I\u2019ve looked, and never found that version. \n\nThe closest I came was this:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xrm6XKnjMlk\n\nIt\u2019s slightly sped up from the original and a bit more fun, but the version I was blasting through the desert listening to in the dead of night was better. Trying to find it was especially frustrating because he has many \u201cversions\u201d of this song where it\u2019s sang or played slightly different. I suppose that\u2019s normal for any band working on their music.\n\nI bet the Denton band mentioned a few comments back is the one OP is looking for. They just need to find the right recorded version of the song.\n\nI\u2019ve actually thought about trying to recreate the song as a cover, simply because the stylistic choices on the vocals were better and I can remember distinctly the way the lines ended with a vocal lift that carried the song.\n\nBut I digress.",
